Notes:

	We should implement 3 algorithms
-DONE		SVM
		Naive Bayes
		Random Forest
		
	Besides the PieceFitness, KingFitness, AttackingFitness, and PST, perhaps we can have
	other features such as
		defensive edges
		mobility
		number of pawns
		number of cannons
		number of etc
		etc

	Games can be won by Red, Black, or a Tie
	
	We can do cross validation for validation.
	
	We can pick a random 5000 boards from the set to be used as the test

TODO:

-DONE	Extract the moves from the tournaments, and link the resultant boards with a label
	
	Store every board with associated label into an array
	
	Make fitness functions be able to evaluate the boards generated from our game

	Change our implementation of soldier move from using ’S’ to using ‘P’ (since that’s what the training data uses)
